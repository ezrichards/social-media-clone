# social-media-clone
This is a basic social media clone web app. This repository is a test
for the curriculum of a web development series for Mines ACM.

# Where's the code?
The code will be distributed over branches to show how the codebase
evolves incrementally over time.

The branches are as follows:
`01-basics` - Website Basics (setting up the project, express, folder structure)
`02-database` - Setting up the Database (MongoDB, hooking up mongoose, making schemas)
`03-backend` - Setting up the backend (routing, security settings, database stuff)
`04-frontend` - Setting up the frontend (Bootstrap, user profiles, displaying MongoDB data)
`05-final` - Wrap Up (anything remaining: security, frontend tweaks, other small things)
